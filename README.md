# Spotify-Clone
This Spotify clone is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It plays a list of Telugu songs, updates the UI dynamically, and automatically moves to the next track when a song ends.
Developed as a front-end practice project, it includes features like custom buttons, a responsive UI, and smooth user experience without any libraries or frameworks.
